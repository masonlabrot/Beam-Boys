# Beam-Boys

## The premise:
- Two players each control a character.
- A beam of destruction connects the characters.
- Enemies wander in from all sides.
- The players work together to kill the enemies with their beam.
- If either character is touched by an enemy, both players lose.

All I have so far is two dots on a screen that are controlled with "awsd" and the arrow keys.

## TODO:
1. Draw beam between dots
2. Enemy movement
3. Enemy/dot collisions
4. Enemy/beam collisions
